# SORCE_penton

This directory contains IDL code in the pro director to analysis SORCE telemetry data in the txt/ directory.

Preliminary analysis is in the TASKS.pages, TASKS.rtf and  TASKS.pdf documents

IÕve run IDL_DOCs on the routines, so there is an html directory here that will help you look at the IDL code in
any web browser.  It is certainly not exquisitely documented, but I tried to put in enough details to show you my thought process.
